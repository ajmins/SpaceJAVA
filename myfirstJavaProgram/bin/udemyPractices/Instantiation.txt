Instantiation in JAVA
----------------------
In Java, instantiation mean to call the constructor of a class that creates an instance or object of the type of that class. 
In other words, creating an object of the class is called instantiation. 
It occupies the initial memory for the object and returns a reference. 
An object instantiation in Java provides the blueprint for the class.

Creating Instances
--------------------
There are two ways to create instances:

	-Using the new Keyword
	-Using Static Factory Method
	
Using the new Keyword
----------------------
Defining a Reference: 
//defines a reference (variable) that can hold an object of the DemoClass  
DemoClass dc;  
  
Instantiation:
DemoClass dc = new DemoClass();  //instantiation  

We can also instantiate the above class as follows if we defining a reference variable.
//creates a DemoClass object (instantiate)  
//new keyword allocates memory space for the newly created object  
dc = new DemoClass();  

We observe that when we use the new keyword followed by the class name, it creates an instance or object of that class. 
Creating a constructor of the class is also known as instantiation.

Note: If we want to invoke the methods of the local inner class, we must instantiate that class.
