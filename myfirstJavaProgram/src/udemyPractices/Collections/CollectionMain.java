/*
 * Binary Search
 * Binary search is a fast search algorithm with run-time complexity of ÎŸ(log n) [avg and worst], best case is O(1). 
 * This search algorithm works on the principle of divide and conquer. 
 * For this algorithm to work properly, the data collection should be in the sorted form.
 * Binary search looks for a particular item by comparing the middle most item of the collection. 
 * If a match occurs, then the index of item is returned. 
 * If the middle item is greater than the item, then the item is searched in the sub-array to the left of the middle item. 
 * Otherwise, the item is searched for in the sub-array to the right of the middle item. 
 * This process continues on the sub-array as well until the size of the subarray reduces to zero.
