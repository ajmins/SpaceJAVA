	/*
	 * Read 10 numbers from the console entered by the user and print the sum of those numbers.
	 * Create a Scanner like we did in the previous video.
	 * Use the hasNextInt() method from the scanner to check if the user has entered an int value.
	 * If hasNextInt() returns false, print the message "Invalid Number". Continue reading until you have read 10 numbers.
	 * Use the nextInt() method to get the number and add it to the sum.

	Before the user enters each number, 
	print the message "Enter number #x:" where x represents the count, i.e. 1, 2, 3, 4, etc.
	For example, the first message printed to the user would be "Enter number #1:", 
	the next "Enter number #2:", and so on.
	Hint: 
	• Use a while loop. 
	• Use a counter variable for counting valid numbers.
	
	Close the scanner after you don't need it anymore. Create a project with the name ReadingUserInputChallenge.
