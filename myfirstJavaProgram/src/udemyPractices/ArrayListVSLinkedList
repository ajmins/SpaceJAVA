ArrayList vs. LinkedList

The LinkedList class is a collection which can contain many objects of the same type, just like the ArrayList.

The LinkedList class has all of the same methods as the ArrayList class because they both implement the List interface. 
This means that you can add items, change items, remove items and clear the list in the same way.

However, while the ArrayList class and the LinkedList class can be used in the same way, they are built very differently.

How the ArrayList works
The ArrayList class has a regular array inside it. 
When an element is added, it is placed into the array. 
If the array is not big enough, a new, larger array is created to replace the old one and the old one is removed.

How the LinkedList works
The LinkedList stores its items in "containers." 
The list has a link to the first container and each container has a link to the next container in the list. 
To add an element to the list, the element is placed into a new container and that container is linked to one of the other containers in the list.

When To Use
Use an ArrayList for storing and accessing data, and LinkedList to manipulate data.

LinkedList provides several methods to do certain operations more efficiently:

Method			Description	
addFirst()		Adds an item to the beginning of the list.	
addLast()		Add an item to the end of the list	
removeFirst()	Remove an item from the beginning of the list.	
removeLast()	Remove an item from the end of the list	
getFirst()		Get the item at the beginning of the list	
getLast()		Get the item at the end of the list

Points
-------
When the rate of addition or removal rate is more than the read scenarios, then go for the LinkedList. 
On the other hand, when the frequency of the read scenarios is more than the addition or removal rate, then ArrayList takes precedence over LinkedList.


Since the elements of an ArrayList are stored more compact as compared to a LinkedList; 
therefore, the ArrayList is more cache-friendly as compared to the LinkedList. 
Thus, chances for the cache miss are less in an ArrayList as compared to a LinkedList. 
Generally, it is considered that a LinkedList is poor in cache-locality.


Memory overhead in the LinkedList is more as compared to the ArrayList. 
It is because, in a LinkedList, we have two extra links (next and previous) as it is required 
to store the address of the previous and the next nodes, and these links consume extra space. 
Such links are not present in an ArrayList.
