	 * Scanner Class
	 * 
	 * The Scanner class reads an entire line and divides the line into tokens. 
	 * Tokens are small elements that have some meaning to the Java compiler.
	 * 
	 	Scanner Input Types
		nextBoolean()	Reads a boolean value from the user
		nextByte()		Reads a byte value from the user
		nextDouble()	Reads a double value from the user
		nextFloat()		Reads a float value from the user
		nextInt()		Reads a int value from the user
		nextLine()		Reads a String value from the user
		nextLong()		Reads a long value from the user
		nextShort()		Reads a short value from the user
	 
	 *To create an object of Scanner class, we usually pass the predefined object System.in, which represents the standard input stream. 
	 *We may pass an object of class File if we want to read input from a file.
	 *To read numerical values of a certain data type XYZ, the function to use is nextXYZ(). 
	 *For example, to read a value of type short, we can use nextShort()
	 *To read strings, we use nextLine().
	 *To read a single character, we use next().charAt(0). 
	 *		next() function returns the next token/word in the input as a string and 
	 *		charAt(0) function returns the first character in that string.
	 *The Scanner class reads an entire line and divides the line into tokens. 
	 *Tokens are small elements that have some meaning to the Java compiler
